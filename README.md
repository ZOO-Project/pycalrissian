# pycalrissian

_pycalrissian_ is a Python client library for running Common Workflow Language (CWL) descriptions on Kubernetes using [Calrissian](https://github.com/Duke-GCB/calrissian).

It provides simple objects and methods to:

* prepare a Kubernetes namespace ready to run Calrissian kubernetes jobs.
* create a Calrissian Kubernetes job in that namespace based on a CWL description and its parameters
* submit and monitor the job execution and retrieve usage, logs and outputs

Refer to the [documentation](https://zoo-project.github.io/pycalrissian/) to get started.

## Development

Use the Visual Studio Code Remote Container configuration.

Requirements:

* in your local `$HOME` you must have a `.kube` folder as it is mounted on the development container to access the kubernetes cluster

**Kubernetes resources for development and testing**

We suggest using microk8s and set the kubeconfig with:

```
microk8s config > ~/.kube/config
```
